This website presents PISCOp V2.1, a new local blended gridded rainfall dataset, headed by the National Service of Meteorology and Hydrology of Peru (SENAMHI).

PISCOp V.2.1 contains daily and monthly rainfall grids at 0.1° computed for 1981–2018*. It is built using serially complete raingauge datasets, CHIRP V2.0(without raingauge stations), radar-gauge merged precipitation climatologies, geostatistics and deterministic interpolation methods, and a simple monthly correction factor applied to daily estimates. More details see the paper [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02626667.2019.1649411).


**STATE OF PISCOp (README!)** 

**Currently, SENAMHI has SUSPENDED the support for the generation of PISCOp V2.1 at near-real-time (latency of eight weeks). It means that you do not be able for access to PISCOp V2.1 rainfall values for dates after to 2018-06-30 (at least by this website). If you need recent PISCOp V2.1 information, please get in contact with Waldo Lavado (wlavado@senamhi.gob.pe) or Fiorella Vega (fvega@senamhi.gob.pe). See the last link about PISCOp at SENAMHI website [here](https://www.senamhi.gob.pe/?p=prensa&n=1003).**
