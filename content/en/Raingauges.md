The raw gauge dataset comprised 945 daily observation dataprovided by SENAMHI. The raingauge data spans the period 1981–2019 and is characterized by a high number of missing valuesand numerous quality issues, being generally caused by the observer at the time of data collection (e.g.incorrect measurement of values ≤1 mm) and instrumentation malfunction. Even though metadata information would help to perform the data quality control, this was not used because of its limited availability. Therefore, our analysis of raingauge datamainly focused on gross error detection and gap-infilling methods. More details see the paper [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02626667.2019.1649411).
