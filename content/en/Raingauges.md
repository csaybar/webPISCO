The raw gauge dataset comprised 945 daily observation dataprovided by SENAMHI. The raingauge data spans the period 1981–2019 and is characterized by a high number of missing valuesand numerous quality issues, being generally caused by the observer at the time of data collection (e.g.incorrect measurement of values ≤1 mm) and instrumentation malfunction. Even though metadata information would help to perform the data quality control, this was not used because of its limited availability. More details see the paper [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02626667.2019.1649411).
